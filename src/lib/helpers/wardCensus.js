// Ported 1:1 from src/lib/wardCensus.js (React). Counts real patient chart
// documents currently on a ward — the single source of truth for "how many
// patients are actually on this ward", used both for the Home page's ward
// patient count and to auto-fill a matching ward report's Previous Occ on
// shift handover (see wardNameMatch.js), so the two numbers a nurse sees
// can't drift apart.
//
// Patients mid-transfer (pendingTransfer set) are excluded — they aren't
// settled on any ward's census yet, the same rule Home's patient list uses
// to hide them until a nurse on the receiving ward accepts or rejects them.
//
// `bedType`, when given, further filters to patients whose pedBedType
// matches — used for PEDIATRIC/NICU WARD's PAED BED / PAED COT split,
// where wardLabel alone can't tell the two apart. Omit it (or pass a
// falsy value) to count the whole ward regardless of bed type.
